📦 Superstore Data Analysis Project
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Superstore dataset, aiming to uncover business insights and trends related to sales performance, customer behavior, and regional operations.

🔍 Key Objectives:
Identify high-performing and underperforming segments and regions.

Analyze patterns in sales, profits, discounts, and shipping costs.

Discover correlations between different business variables.

📊 Visualizations Used:
The notebook features several types of data visualizations to support findings:

Bar charts: For comparing sales/profit across categories and regions.

Line plots: To visualize trends over time (e.g., monthly or yearly).

Heatmaps: To show correlations between numerical features.

Box plots & histograms: For examining distributions of sales and discounts.

⚠️ Note: Visual outputs like charts and graphs won't render in GitHub’s Markdown preview. To view them, open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
